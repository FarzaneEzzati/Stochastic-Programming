    "Problem: A company would like to determine the number of phisical servers type 1,2,3 that must be purchased right now. After the realization of monthly demand, virtual servers can handle the demand as well as physical ones. The company wants to determine the total number of physical and virtual servers of each type that need to be purchased.\n",
    "The distribution of demand is normal with parameters N1(75,8), N2(8,3), N3(18,2).\n",
    "Each server is used for only one unit of demand.\n",
    "The company has limitations of total invested budget and occupied physical space which are $1100, 90 respectively.\n",
    "The cost of each virtual server is 8,20,33. The investment cost for each physical server is 7,12,25. Also, each physical server occupies 1,5,4 units.\n",
